# Introduction

As covid-19 is a buzz word in today's time, so with use of the ML and Visualizing tools we have created a small project on Covid-19. It will help us to understand the covid-19 in better way. <br>
This DataScience project is in two parts-<br>
1 Google colab file <br>
2  Tableau (link below)<br>
We had taken Covid-19 dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data (Same dataset is in repository, Data upto - 29/June/2021)<br>
## Colab file
Have done <b>Preprocessing</b> and fetched some countries for visulaization and answering some general questions for covid-19 like-<br>
Country with Highest and lowest Number of Cases, Deaths, Vaccinations?<br>
In <b>Second part</b> of colab file have done **Forecasting** of upcoming month(July) and have sumed up the Cases, Deaths, Vaccinations numbers For India and United States.<br>
